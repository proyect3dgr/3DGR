# 3DGR
# Welcome to 3DGR. Our final project inside the Ironhack web-development bootcamp. This project consists in a marketplace for 3D assets where the user could buy or upload their own models. 

#This is done with ReactJS for the front-end and NodeJS with Express and Passport for the back-end. We also use Sass to manage CSS using the 7-1 approach.

#We used THREEJS to build a Visualizer where we can upload the models and see them in real time.

#If you want to fork this project, remember to do an npm i in both folders.
